        <h2>About the tool</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The tool is developed in
            <span class="span-comp">Java, version 10 or higher</span>, so you
            will need to have Java installed on your system.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            It is recommended that your graphics card drivers are up to date.
            Both the extraction of the monitor's capabilities string and the
            sending of signals are performed from the GPU. An outdated or old
            graphics card may not be compatible.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In the shopping section you can find a free tool to check your
            monitor's compatibility with DDC and VCP codes, please do not buy
            the tool without being sure of compatibility, the codes are used to
            change inputs and brightness, without compatibility you will only be
            able to turn off the monitors, change the orientation and refresh
            rate.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It is possible that extractions may fail occasionally, please
            restart the tool or press the button again, this may occur due to
            other processes or monitor delay, the rate of these failures is very
            low, it is recommended to read the information about DDC in its
            section below. <br />
            If the brightness level selector and its value can be read but
            changes cannot be applied, this is because the monitor's factory
            software only has read permissions enabled, not write permissions.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            It is important that Java has administrator privileges, as the
            Windows User32 API is used to communicate with the monitor. The VCP
            (Virtual Control Panel) commands use JNA (Java Native Access) to
            directly interact with User32.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            If you encounter any problems or have any questions about the
            compatibility of your monitor, please do not hesitate to
            <a href="soporte.html">contact us</a>.

        <h2>Information about DDC (Display Data Channel)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Monitor Response Time:</span> Some monitors may have variable
            response times for processing DDC/CI or VCP commands. This can be
            due to the monitor's firmware implementation, the speed of the
            communication bus, the current load on the monitor's internal
            processor, among other factors.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span> Communication Delays:</span> Communication between the
            application and the monitor via DDC/CI or VCP can experience delays
            due to data transmission speed, congestion on the communication bus
            (especially if multiple queries are being made in short intervals),
            or even environmental factors that could affect the signal.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>Wait Between Queries:</span> To mitigate issues related to
            monitor recovery times, it is advisable to have adequate pauses
            between queries. For example, after sending a brightness adjustment
            command, it is prudent to wait a brief period before making another
            query or adjustment to give the monitor time to process the previous
            command and prepare for the next.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>Physical Connection or Hardware Configuration:</span>
            Intermittent issues may be related to the configuration or physical
            connection of the monitors. This includes issues like loose cables,
            electrical power problems, hardware issues in the monitors
            themselves, etc.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span> Communication with the Monitor:</span> Communication with
            monitors via interfaces like DXVA2 and JNA depends on several
            external factors, such as the stability of hardware drivers, the
            API's compatibility with the driver version, and possibly the
            operating system configuration.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span> External Interference:</span> External factors such as
            electromagnetic interference, electrical network issues, or even
            other connected devices can affect communication and monitor
            detection.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span> Operating System Behavior:</span> Sometimes, the behavior of
            the operating system, such as resource management or application
            concurrency, can influence your application's ability to properly
            interact with hardware devices like monitors.
