            <strong>Comprehensive Feature List:</strong> The test will display
            every feature available in the Multi Monitor Manager program, such
            as brightness control, contrast adjustment, input source selection
            ...

            <strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> This section includes two visual
            markers:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>A green checkmark (✓)</strong> indicates that the
                feature is fully supported by your monitor.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>A red cross (✗)</strong> indicates that the feature is
                not supported by your monitor.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <hr />
            <strong>Evaluate Compatibility:</strong> Based on the results,
            you'll be able to clearly see which features the Multi Monitor
            Manager can control on your monitor(s). For any feature that shows a
            red cross (✗), you will need to decide whether the lack of support
            for that specific function is important to you.
            <hr />

            <strong>Make an Informed Decision:</strong> We recommend reviewing
            the rest of the website, where you'll find detailed information
            about all the features and capabilities of the program. This will
            help you understand how much control you’ll have over your
            monitor(s) and assess whether the unsupported features are critical
            for your use.
