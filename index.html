          <h2>Compatibility</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The tool is developed in
              <span class="span-comp">Java, version 10 or higher</span>, so you
              will need to have Java installed on your system.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Support for up to four monitors, maximum three inputs for the
              parameters, if you have more the first three will be used.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The tool does not have a digital signature, as it is a personal
              project and the licenses have a high price.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              It is recommended that your graphics card drivers are up to date.
              Both the extraction of the monitor's capabilities string and the
              sending of signals are performed from the GPU. An outdated or old
              graphics card may not be compatible.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              In the shopping section you can find a
              <a

                free tool</a
              >
              to check your monitor's compatibility with DDC and VCP codes,
              please do not buy the tool without being sure of compatibility,
              the codes are used to change inputs and brightness, without
              compatibility you will only be able to turn off the monitors,
              change the orientation and refresh rate.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              It is possible that extractions may fail occasionally, please
              restart the tool or press the button again, this may occur due to
              other processes or monitor delay, the rate of these failures is
              very low, it is recommended to read the information about DDC in
              its section below. <br />
              If the brightness level selector and its value can be read but
              changes cannot be applied, this is because the monitor's factory
              software only has read permissions enabled, not write permissions.
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
              It is important that Java has administrator privileges, as the
              Windows User32 API is used to communicate with the monitor. The
              VCP (Virtual Control Panel) commands use JNA (Java Native Access)
              to directly interact with User32.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Monitor Response Time:</span> Some monitors may have
              variable response times for processing DDC/CI or VCP commands.
              This can be due to the monitor's firmware implementation, the
              speed of the communication bus, the current load on the monitor's
              internal processor, among other factors.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span> Communication Delays:</span> Communication between the
              application and the monitor via DDC/CI or VCP can experience
              delays due to data transmission speed, congestion on the
              communication bus (especially if multiple queries are being made
              in short intervals), or even environmental factors that could
              affect the signal.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>Wait Between Queries:</span> To mitigate issues related to
              monitor recovery times, it is advisable to have adequate pauses
              between queries. For example, after sending a brightness
              adjustment command, it is prudent to wait a brief period before
              making another query or adjustment to give the monitor time to
              process the previous command and prepare for the next.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>Physical Connection or Hardware Configuration:</span>
              Intermittent issues may be related to the configuration or
              physical connection of the monitors. This includes issues like
              loose cables, electrical power problems, hardware issues in the
              monitors themselves, etc.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span> Communication with the Monitor:</span> Communication with
              monitors via interfaces like DXVA2 and JNA depends on several
              external factors, such as the stability of hardware drivers, the
              API's compatibility with the driver version, and possibly the
              operating system configuration.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span> External Interference:</span> External factors such as
              electromagnetic interference, electrical network issues, or even
              other connected devices can affect communication and monitor
              detection.

            <br />
            <li>
              <span> Operating System Behavior:</span> Sometimes, the behavior
              of the operating system, such as resource management or
              application concurrency, can influence your application's ability
              to properly interact with hardware devices like monitors.

        <h1 translate="no">MULTI MONITOR MANAGER</h1>
        <br />
        <ul class="listaVideo">
          <li>
            The program is specifically designed to manage multi-monitor
            configurations.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            With a single monitor, you would need to manually switch inputs
            using physical buttons after changing the input, which this program
            aims to eliminate.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Imagine performing various tasks on your computer, such as data
            conversion, downloads, or video rendering, all while using your
            primary monitor.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In this scenario, you could have a console or an Android TV device
            connected to the same monitor and switch the input directly from the
            secondary device.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            This way, you can continue to monitor your computer activities on a
            secondary screen and switch back to the primary input whenever you
            want, thus avoiding the hassle of using physical buttons located at
            the back or side of the monitor.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            This is especially beneficial in setups where monitors are
            positioned close together or are mounted on walls or desk arms,
            making physical buttons difficult to access.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Additionally, if you have two computer towers connected to the same
            monitor, you can use the tool on each PC to seamlessly switch inputs
            or turn the monitor off.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            This provides an effortless way to manage multiple devices with a
            single monitor, enhancing your workflow and reducing the need for
            manual intervention.

            I have used artificial intelligence (AI) to generate many of the
            images you see here. However, AI is just a tool to help me realize
            my creative vision. Every idea, every artistic direction, and every
            detail has been carefully conceptualized and refined by me. Writing
            and adjusting the prompts, selecting the best results, making the
            necessary edits, and having a clear idea of ââwhat you want requires
            not only technical skills, but also a dose of creativity and
            personal effort. I respect and consider essential the work of
            creative teams in large business projects. However, I want to
            emphasize that this is a personal project, trying to capture the
            emotion and effort of a first project, and carried out with a clear
            vision and an honest approach. I hope that by sharing my process and
            the dedication behind my work, I can earn your trust,
            differentiating my project from those who seek to sell smoke through
            the generic use of AI.
