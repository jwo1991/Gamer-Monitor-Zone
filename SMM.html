            <h2>GENERAL MAINTENANCE</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Routine Cleaning:</strong> Conduct a thorough cleaning
                of the system at least every three months. This includes
                removing accumulated dust from the case, fans, and filters. Use
                compressed air to clean internal components and a soft cloth for
                external surfaces. Ensure to clean the CPU and GPU coolers, as
                dust can obstruct airflow and lead to overheating.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Environmental Considerations:</strong> Keep the PC in a
                cool, dry environment, away from direct sunlight and sources of
                humidity. An ideal ambient temperature range is between 15°C and
                25°C (59°F to 77°F). Additionally, ensure there is adequate
                space around the PC to allow for proper airflow.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>System Performance Monitoring:</strong> Utilize SMM to
                track CPU and GPU performance. Regularly review reports
                generated by SMM to ensure CPU temperatures remain within the
                ideal range of 30-70°C under load and that GPU temperatures stay
                between 60-85°C. Pay attention to any alerts regarding elevated
                temperatures or excessive resource usage.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Software Maintenance:</strong> Keep your operating
                system and applications up to date to ensure optimal
                functionality and security. Regularly check for BIOS and
                firmware updates that may enhance stability and performance.
                Review SMM drivers and software to ensure you are using the
                latest version.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Surge Protection:</strong> Protecting the system from
                power surges is critical. Use a high-quality surge protector and
                consider investing in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to
                safeguard against power outages and fluctuations that could
                damage your PC components.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Temperature Monitoring:</strong> Use SMM to monitor CPU
                temperatures. Ensure temperatures remain below 80°C under load.
                Be vigilant for any sudden temperature spikes and take immediate
                action if thresholds are exceeded.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid Overclocking:</strong> If you decide to overclock,
                ensure you have a clear understanding of the CPU specifications
                and temperature limits. Use SMM to monitor performance and
                temperature changes during overclocking.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Thermal Paste Replacement:</strong> It is advisable to
                replace thermal paste every 2-3 years or each time the CPU
                cooler is removed. Utilize high-quality thermal paste to ensure
                efficient heat transfer, which is crucial for maintaining
                optimal CPU temperatures.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Check Adequate Cooling:</strong> Periodically inspect
                the CPU cooler to ensure it is mounted correctly and functioning
                properly. Ensure that the fans are spinning freely and that
                airflow within the chassis is sufficient.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Power Supply Check:</strong> Ensure the power supply
                unit (PSU) meets the requirements of your CPU. Verify that the
                PSU has an 80 Plus certification to ensure efficiency and
                stability, which is important to avoid voltage fluctuations that
                could affect performance.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Temperature Monitoring:</strong> Use SMM to monitor GPU
                temperatures. Keep temperatures below 85°C under load. If you
                notice a significant increase, consider inspecting the cooling
                system and cleaning the GPU fans.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid Overclocking:</strong> Overclocking the GPU can be
                risky; ensure you understand the manufacturer’s specifications.
                Use SMM to monitor performance stability while applying any
                overclocking settings.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Thermal Paste Cleaning:</strong> Replace thermal paste
                on the GPU every 2-3 years, especially if the GPU is used for
                high-performance tasks. This helps maintain good thermal
                conductivity and prevents overheating.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Inspect for Graphical Artifacts:</strong> Monitor for
                any graphical artifacts or performance issues using SMM. The
                presence of these can indicate overheating or hardware failures,
                requiring immediate attention.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Driver Updates:</strong> Keep GPU drivers updated. SMM
                can assist you in checking the current version and alerting you
                about necessary updates to ensure compatibility and optimal GPU
                performance.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Power Supply Evaluation:</strong> Verify that the power
                supply meets the power requirements of the GPU, particularly for
                high-performance models. An 80 Plus Gold certified power supply
                is recommended for gaming and graphics-intensive systems.
